# ZeOS

ZeOS is a simple kernel built for the subject of SOA (Advanced Operating Systems) at FIB-UPC on spring 2023 by [Albert Canales](https://github.com/albertcanales) and [Arnau Valls](https://github.com/Toomoch). There are two implementations of the OS:

- `entregues`: The first part of the course, which had a strict list of functionalities to be implemented.
- `projecte`: The second part of the course, which includes a free topic final project, in our case a *Snake* game.

Moreover, Arnau did a flake for ZeOS development which is appended to this project. The standalone flakes can be found [here](https://github.com/Toomoch/SOA-ZeOS-fib-nix).
